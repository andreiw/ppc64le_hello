ppc64le_hello - ``Hello World'' for a Little-Endian OpenPower world
===================================================================

This is an example of running a 64-bit little-endian payload using
skiboot (https://github.com/open-power/skiboot) or another OPAL
firmware.

It shows the bare minimum needed to start writing
a little-endian kernel for the OpenPower ecosystem. Whereas
skiboot/test/hello_world is big-endian, this shows how
to make OPAL calls from LE as well as other minutiae like
setting up a basic C environment.

What you get:
- 64-bit real-mode HV LE operation
- logging via sim inteface (mambo_write)
- logging via OPAL firmware (opal_write)
- calling C code, stack/BSS/linkage setup/TOC
- calling BE code from LE
- FDT parsing, dumping FDT
- Taking and returning from exceptions, handling
  unrecoverable/nested exceptions.
- Timebase (i.e. the "timestamp counter"), decrementer
  and hypervisor decrementer manipulation.
- Very basic MMU setup (1:1 EA->VA mapping using a 1TB
  SLB entry, and 1:1 VA->RA mapping using 4K pages
  for memory between &_start and &_end. Not SMP safe.
  Note that since only a few areas are mapped, attempt
  to access an unmapped area with the MMU on will force
  the MMU off (see exc.c).
- Running unpriviledged code.

Hopefully the code is clear enough and not too messy. I'm not trying hard
enough ;-(. I think the only code that has had any thought put into it
is the exception vectors, and other places look especially crappy because
I wanted to avoid writing an actual kernel.

Building
========

You will need a LE 64-bit toolchain to build (i.e. powerpc64le-linux-gnu-gcc).
For building skiboot (for testing) you will also need the BE 64-bit
toolchain (i.e. powerpc64-linux-gnu-gcc).

Skiboot is pulled-in as a submodule. 

You will need the POWER8 Functional Simulator set up. Good directions: https://www.flamingspork.com/blog/2014/12/03/running-skiboot-opal-on-the-power8-simulator/

$ make

Running
=======

$ make test

This will run the simulator and pop-up an xterm for OPAL console 0. If you
don't like xterm, feel free to change it in ppc64le_hello.tcl.

You can interact with this:
(d) poll the timebase registers until 5s of real time pass.
(e) tests triggering a system call with parameter 0xfeed. The system
    call handler will return back parameter << 16 | 0xface, i.e. 0xfeedface.
(n) tests triggering an exception from an exception by triggering
    a system call with parameter 0xdead. The exc.c logic keys off the parameter
    to trigger another exception, expectedly crashing the system, thus testing
    that the exc.c code can distinguish between recoverable and non-recoverable
    exceptions and handle them appropriately.
(f) dumps the FDT passed up by skiboot. I don't try very hard. This code needs
    improvement and its just glue around parts of libfdt.
(M) enables running with MSR.IR and MSR.DR. The page table and SLB are setup at
    boot to map 1:1 (EA->RA) exactly the memory between &_start and &_end. Any
    DSI/ISI turns off the MMU. Exceptions never keep MMU on inside the exceptions.
(m) disables MSR.IR and MSR.DR, disabling MMU.
(t) simple test for MMU code, mapping the same EA to different RAs and verifying
    that the mapping worked.
(u) shows running unpriviledged code. There's no scheduler, process/thread support
    so the hand-off between code is messy. We enter user code via syscall, saving
    off the exception frame for a subsequent return from user code, again via
    syscall.
(I) enables external interrupts (MSR.EE). You will start seeing decrementer
    exceptions.
(i) disables external interrupts. You will no longer see any decrementer
    or HV decrementer exceptions.
(H) enables HV decrementer. If exernal interrupts are on, you will start
    seeting hypervisor decrementer exceptions.
(h) disable HV decrementer. You will no longer see any HV decrementer
    exceptions.
(q) will shut down the sim using the attn instruction.

You should be able to run ppc64le_hello on a real Power8 machine via skiboot,
but you will need to comment out the call to mambo_write, as that is a
simulator-only facility.

Wish I had Power8 kit to play with ;-(.

Issues
======

Q: Delay test seems to run longer or shorter than 5s wall clock.
A: From benh: "The way mambo (aka systemsim) works, there is no expectation that the
               simulated timebase has any relationship whatsoever to wall clock outside
               of sim. All you can do really is play with the ratio emulated CPU
               cycles / TB cycles."
   ...change processor/cpu_frequency and processor/timebase_frequency. On my
   machine (i5-2410M) the TB should run about 1000 times faster than clock.
